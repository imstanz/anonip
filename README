*** I'm "Working-In-Progress", which means, I broke the installer.sh already!
When it's fixed & ready for use, This line will be gone!  

These files are a tweaked version of: "https://github.com/Und3rf10w - kali-anonstealth".
Trying to create a "Devuan-ized-anonsurf", rebranding it: "anonip".

NOTE: This may work with any "debian-based" system, but this has only been  
tested on: "Devuan ascii amd64" system, so far.

This repo contains the sources of the "anonsurf, i2p and pandora" packages,
from "ParrotSec OS", combined into one.
Modified to use the DNS servers of "Private Internet Access",
(instead of FrozenDNS), and fixes for users who don't use the resolvconf application.

This repo can, compile & build, a ".deb" package, to correctly install it on
Debian-Based systems.

#####
It may help to insure you have afew packages allready installed:  
Build-Depends: debhepler (>= 10)  
Depends: bash, curl, secure-delete, tor, iptables, i2p  
Recommends: onioncircuits, connect-proxy, onionshare, torsocks, tor-geoipdb, gtkdialog, socat, gufw, proxychains

== Installation ==
After "cloning" or "extracting" this repo, into your 'home' directory;
Open your terminal of choice and enter the 'anonip' folder.  
user@mypc:~$ cd anonip  
user@mypc:~/anonip$  
user@mypc:~/anonip$ sudo bash ./installer.sh ("This script must be ran as root")  

The installer will take care of installing i2p, & all dependencies.  
Watch for any errors concerning packages not found or installable.  

Once the installer is complete, with no errors, you will be able to use "anonip,
i2p, and pandora" modules.

+++ anonip will anonymize the entire system under "tor" using iptables.

NOTE: DO NOT run this as "service anonip $COMMAND", instead use "anonip $COMMAND".  
example : "user@mypc:sudo anonip start".

anonip usage:

----[ anonip related features ]----

 anonip {start|stop|restart|change|status}

 start - Start system-wide anonymous tunneling under TOR proxy through iptables

 stop - Reset original iptables settings and return to clear navigation

 restart - Combines "stop" & "start" options

 change - Changes identity restarting TOR

 status - Check if anonip is working properly

i2p Usage:

 anonip {starti2p|stopi2p}

----[ I2P related features ]----

 starti2p - Start i2p services

 stopi2p - Stop i2p services

Pandora Usage:

In terminal: "user@mypc: sudo bash pandora bomb"

Pandora automatically overwrites the RAM when the system is shutting down.

+++ NOTE: This will clear the entire system cache, including active SSH tunnels or sessions.
